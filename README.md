# Extracting dominant colours from images using K means clustering

This Jupyter notebook aims to show how to use the K means clustering algorithm and how to pick an optimal value for K using the elbow plot method, in order to extract the dominant colours from images. A range of libraries are used to achieve and illustrate this result such as Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy and scki-kit learn. 

## Getting Started

You can the find documentation for installing Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org/install) or for more detailed instructions on installation [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) 

For local installation, make sure you have pip installed and run:

`
pip install notebook
`

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running locally

launch with

`
$ jupyter notebook
`

### Running remotely

You will need to make some configurations before running the Jupyter notebook remotely, see [docs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html)
